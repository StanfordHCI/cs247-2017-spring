            <p>To start, <a href="/2017-spring/exercises/exercise.zip">download the materials</a>. In the folder <code>exercise</code>, you'll find the <code>index.html</code> page that we will be working with.</p>
            <p>
              <a class="btn btn-primary" href="/2017-spring/exercises/exercise.zip">Download Materials</a>

            <h3 id="one" >Cleaning up</h3>
            <p>We'll practice our skills with handling negative space by stripping away parts of the homepage to create a cleaner, less cluttered feel. Remember, negative space might be empty, but it's not meaningless: it helps define structure and call out important parts of a page. </p>
            <p>There are two ways you can do this: open <code>index.html</code> in your Chrome browser, and then hit <code>View > Developer > Developer Tools </code>. From here, you can directly delete parts of the website and edit the CSS. This is easy and quick, but won't let you save your editsâ€”so don't hit reload! Alternatively, you can edit the CSS directly in the css files under the <code>english_files</code> directory. <p>
            <p>If you edit the CSS, you can try <code>display:none</code> (the page acts as if the element doesn't exist), or <code>visibility:hidden</code> (the page acts as if the element is still there, but invisible). </p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div id="extra" class="sidenav-anchor">
          <h1>Additional tasks</h1>
          <p class="lead">If you completed the first exercise quickly and have time so spare we have some additional ideas for redesigning.</p>

          <div class="sidenav-anchor" id="color">
            <h3 id="three">Color </h3>
            <p>Now we will redesign the CSF English Department page in terms of the color choices. </p>
            <p>You'll be changing these colors to convey the concept you defined in your moodboard and create a strong aesthetic. As before, you can edit colors through the Developer Tools in your Chrome browser, or edit the CSS files at <code>exercise/english_files</code> directly.</p>
            <p>A helpful resource is <a href="https://color.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Color</a>, which helps you find colors that go well together. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="sidenav-anchor" id="typefaces">
             <h3 id="four">Typefaces</h3>
           <p> Now we'll practice editing typefaces. Make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U-OaHCZJ6DXAHrOrc4mTV7B_2K-t37G6Ny8UQL5Dcoc/edit?usp=sharing">this mockup of the content</a> of the CSF website (File > Make a Copy).</p>
           <p> Then, in your copy, edit the typefaces and styling to achieve something a little more aesthetically pleasing and readable. </p>
           <p> You have full access to the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> catalog in Google Drive. At the bottom of the dropdown for selecting a font, you'll see a "More Fonts" button, which takes you to this catalog. You can also play around with the fonts directly on the Google Fonts website. </p>
           <p> For some inspiring ways to combine fonts, take a look at websites like <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> that make cool choices, design sites like <a href="https://www.behance.net">Behance</a>, or typeface websites like <a href="http://fontpair.co">Fontpair</a>. </p>
