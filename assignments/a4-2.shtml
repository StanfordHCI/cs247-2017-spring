                    <p>
                    Pick one of your mockups and implement it. Start with the basics and then work to duplicate your pixel-perfect mocks. Build all of the interactive elements of your design, iterating on them if you need to.</p>

                    <h2>Video</h2>
                    <p>Create a short (1-2 minute) video to serve as an introduction to your interactive explanation. Think of it like a movie trailer - it should show enough to get user excited to visit your site. In addition to giving a breif overview of the concept, your video should show the key interactive elements and the visual design elements that you are proud of.

                    <h2>Final Presentation Poster</h2>
                    <p>You will need a <b>20"x30"</b> poster to tell judges about your interactive explanation. We want to know the key design decisions you made, what lessons your learned from prototyping and the insights behind your final design.</p>
                    <p>
                    This is a chance to show off your visual design skills. A common error is to put too much content on the poster. Keep it simple: convey the problem and how it is being solved by your design. We will provide easels; you will need to print out and mount your poster on a stiff backing so that it can stand alone on the easel. Posters can be printed at <a href="https://acomp.stanford.edu/techlounge/posters">Lathrop</a>, <a href="http://www.costcophotocenter.com/Shop/Posters#/PosterBoards/posterboard/20x30">Costco ($25)</a>, <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/poster-printing.html?lid=posterpic_copyingservices_posters">FedEx</a> or <a href="http://photo.walgreens.com/walgreens/info1/isfrom=_walgreens_posterscreateflow">Walgreens ($24)</a>. They usually have a 1-2 day turnaround. You can order online and pick it up from the store.</p>
                    <p>Look on piazza for examples of good posters from last year.</p>
