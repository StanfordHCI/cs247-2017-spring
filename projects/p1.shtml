                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of P1 is to introduce you to critique as a component of how design is evaluated and improved.</p>

                    <!--
                    <p><b>Needfinding is "deep hanging out".</b> CS 147 focused on contextual inquiry-style user research. Needfinding is a much broader activity that involves more open-ended observation and interviewing. We'll begin getting comfortable with that here.</p>
                    -->

                    <!-- The first goal of P1 is to abandon a common error that new designers make: focusing on raw, surface-level description in needfinding. When students graduate from CS 147, typically their needfinding observations are still extremely surface-level (e.g., "It was loud, so we should find ways to make it quieter.") This time, the expectations are higher. We'll aim to turn those observations into focused needs.</p> -->

                    <!--<p><b>Design requires communication.</b> The better your communication cuts to the core of the idea, the more effective you are as a designer. It's your responsibility to ensure that others see the same thing in your ideas that you do. If they see something else, you need to accept a <i>mea culpa</i>: there's something you're not communicating clearly. Visual communication is a kind of interface design: if the recipient doesn't rapidly get it, then the interface (communication) needs to be tweaked.</p>-->

                    <h2>Equip yourself</h2>
                    <p>A good drawing pad or sketchbook is a critical part of the designer's toolkit. Make sure you've purchased a pad and pen and bring it to class on Friday. Act quickly, because we are not the only class on campus that's asking you to buy a sketchbook and they do sell out. Important features: <b>you must be able to easily tear out the pages</b> (so we can tape them on the walls), no lines, no flimsy pages, no tiny pages (we recommend at least 5"x8"), no thin-lined pens (go for something with a reasonably thick ink stream), and no pencils. The Stanford Bookstore sells drawing pads, as does <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Art/@37.473066,-122.217582,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbb3a2902b9fb:0x40d44f8e06f1dc56">University Art</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Accent+Arts/@37.426745,-122.144873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbae5939d8a8d:0x51810dd03fc0d3d1">Accent Arts</a>.

                    <h2>Details</h2>
                    You will author two critiques for this assignment. For the first critique, pick an interface that someone else created: an app that you're interested in, a web interface, or an interactive physical product. For the second critique, pick an interface that you've created, perhaps in CS 147.</p>

                    <p>Critique each interface. Each critique should be no more than 300 words. Feel free to use a combination of text and visuals. Remember that a critique is "deeper" than a usability inspection. Please begin each critique with a full page screengrab of the interface so that we can see it clearly.</p>

                    <p>Finally, write up one paragraph answering the following questions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is your assessment subjective?</li>
                            <li>Do you think the subjectivity invalidates your assessment?</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Print out full-page versions of the interfaces or your annotated visual critique and bring it to class on Friday. We'll be looking at each others' work!</p>

                    <p>Please post any questions about this project or others to the class Piazza forum.</p>
