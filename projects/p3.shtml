                    <p>As with P2, your team can work on P3 at its own pace until the deadline on February 13. As you proceed through the milestones, submit them to Canvas before class and by bringing printouts to class to show in studio.</p>

                    <h2>Grading rubric</h2>
                    <p>Each intermediate milestone is worth five points. You will receive five points for completing the assignment satisfactorily, submitting it, and your whole team bringing your sketches to studio for feedback.
                    <a href="p3-3.shtml">Part III</a>, the final submission, will be the only part of the assignment where we evaluate your work and assign points. It is worth 15 points.
