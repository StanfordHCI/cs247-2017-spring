                    <h2>Final feedback and prototype</h2>
                    <p>Use your critiques, and if there's time, a final set of feedback from the field, to pick one idea to revise and refine. Your end goal is a revised prototype of your selected idea. Remember that this is still a prototype, so it's not expected to be software. But it should be more realized than what you had in Part II. The more effectively you can fake it, the more compellingly your prototype will communicate.</p>

                    <p>Write up a final summary: what need is being addressed? What approach are you taking? Include your updated parts I and II here so you have a cohesive story of what you did. What feedback drove you toward the current design? And how does it work? Be sure to capture your prototype via video or photos.</p>

                    <h4>On Canvas</h4>
                    <p>Pull everything from P3 together into your submission for P3.III on Canvas. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A PDF with your final summary of all three project parts and your prototype. Video optional.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>In Studio</h4>
                    <p>Present your final prototype in up to eight minutes in studio. Cover the need being addressed, your high level insight, user feedback, and the prototype itself. Bring your prototype for show-and-tell.</p>
                    <h4>Team Dynamics Checkin</h4>
                    <p>Please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/zLJ0W4ja0hWZzxgh2">submit a team assessment form</a> (one for every member of the team). You will only get credit for P3-3 when every member of your team submits a form.</p>
